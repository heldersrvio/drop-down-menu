# Drop-down Menu

A drop-down menu module for JavaScript projects.

It's exported as a function named 'newDropDownMenu', which takes as (required) arguments the document, the 'leadingItemId', the 'menuItemsContainerId', the 'menuItemsClass' and 'clickOrHover', which interprets true as 'click' and false, as 'hover'.

One of three UIModules, the other two being an [Image Slider](https://github.com/heldersrvio/image-slider) and a [Mobile Menu].
